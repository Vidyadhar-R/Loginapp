# LoginApp

LoginApp is a simple web application designed to demonstrate basic user authentication functionality using a username and password. This app can serve as the foundation for more advanced authentication systems with features such as session management, password hashing, and database integration.

## Features

- **Username and Password Input**: Basic form for user login.
- **Authentication Simulation**: Verifies credentials against predefined values (to be extended for actual database or API integration).
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

---

## Requirements

- **Web Browser**: Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- **Node.js** (if backend integration is required).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vidyadhar-R/Loginapp.git

3. **Install dependencies** (if applicable):

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   For a simple frontend:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
   
   For a backend (Node.js or Express setup):
   - Run the server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

2. **Login**:  
   Enter any username and password to simulate the login process. Modify the logic to implement more secure authentication mechanisms.
